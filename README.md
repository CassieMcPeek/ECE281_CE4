Computer Exercise 4

# Part A

This part was pretty straight forward. We were supposed to load and store 3 seperate values in different locations. The part I 
ran into trouble at was placing the operands into the RAM section below the ROM section of the program. Once I realized that
that was where you placed the locations to store the values, it made the program a lot easier.
